# Hi, I'm Mishal! 👋

🎓 **MS in Artificial Intelligence** from [NUST, Islamabad](https://nust.edu.pk), with a strong foundation in Computer Engineering.  
💻 Skilled in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Data Analysis**.  
🚀 Worked on projects like **Anomaly Detection** and **Energy Consumption Analysis**, applying AI to real-world challenges.  
🔬 Formerly managed undergraduate internships and presented lab projects at NCAI's **Deep Learning Lab**.  
👨‍🏫 Currently, I teach AI and Data Science on [Preply](https://preply.com/en/tutor/2059359), helping students enhance their skills.

📚 **MS Research Project**:  
🔍 My MS research focused on **Automating Legal Text Summarization with Multi-Agent Systems and Human-Centered Evaluation**. The project aimed to streamline the summarization of complex legal documents using advanced AI techniques. 

Key aspects of the project include:
- Developed a **multi-agent system** where each agent specialized in tasks like **extracting key points**, **rephrasing content**, and **evaluating summaries**.
- Utilized **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to generate concise, accurate summaries while maintaining the essence of legal documents.
- Integrated a **human-centered evaluation framework**, incorporating custom evaluation metrics like **ROUGE scores** to assess the quality of AI-generated summaries against human-generated ones.
- The project demonstrated the potential of AI in enhancing legal processes by improving efficiency and providing insights into applying multi-agent systems in the legal domain.

🌱 I'm passionate about continuous learning and using AI to drive meaningful technological advancements.
